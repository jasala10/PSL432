## Projects from PSL432: Theoretical Neurophysiology

An intro to machine learning and control theory course, with an unassuming departmental designation (physiology!) My favourite course I've ever taken â€“ kickstarted my passion for machine learning. While quite theory-heavy, implications on biological systems were discussed in class. I took this course in the Winter semester of 2024. 

- **Project 1**: Using control theory to get a two-jointed arm to track a moving target using Hurwitz desired dynamics

- **Project 2:**: Developing a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Architecture features a skip connection for additional complexity with the backprop implementation

- **Project 3:**: Implementing a specified variant of the Deep-Deterministic Policy Gradient algoithm (reinforcement learning)
